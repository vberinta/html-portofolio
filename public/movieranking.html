    <h2>My top three movies of all-time.</h2>

    <h3>The Avengers</h3>
    <img src="../../images/avengers.jpg" />
    <p>
      This is my favourite SF movie. It includes all the marvel heroes I grew up
      watching on TV.

    <h3>The office</h3>
    <img src="../../images/the office.jpg" />
    <p>
      A comedy documental showing the day to day life of an American office. I
      think you have to understand the american humos in orden to like this
      series.
    </p>
    <h3>Band of brothers</h3>
    <img src="../../images/bandofborthers.jpg" />
    <p>
      This is a series I started watching recently. It kind of thouched me
      deeply because its showing the events that happened during world war II.
